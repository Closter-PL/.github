# Planning Methodology

> **Important:** This document explains how Closter's planning system works, connecting strategic roadmap to day-to-day execution.

## Overview

Closter uses a four-tier planning system that bridges strategic vision with tactical execution:

1. **Roadmap** (external / strategic)
2. **Milestones** (bridge)
3. **Issues** (real execution)
4. **Weekly Planning** (the key)

---

## Step 1 — Roadmap (External / Strategic)

- Defines phases
- Defines dates
- Defines outcomes
- Is stable
- Can be shared

👉 **"This is what we say externally."**

The roadmap (see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)) provides a high-level strategic view of Closter's progression from core infrastructure to operational launch. It's designed for external stakeholders, investors, and strategic planning.

---

## Step 2 — Milestones (Bridge)

- Each roadmap phase → 1 milestone
- The milestone has an approximate date
- Many issues live inside it

👉 **"This connects business with execution."**

Milestones serve as the bridge between strategic roadmap phases and tactical issue execution. They provide structure and alignment without being overly rigid.

### 📌 Official Closter Milestones (GitHub)

#### Milestone 0.1 – The Engine
**Due date:** January 27, 2026

**Description:**
Establish the core operational backbone of Closter.
This milestone delivers the foundational infrastructure required for all subsequent workflows, including backend architecture, admin application, operational database, hybrid authentication, and media infrastructure.

**Outcome:**
- Core platform is operational
- Internal admin/intake surface is usable
- System boundaries and integrations are defined

---

#### Milestone 0.5 – The Brain
**Due date:** February 4, 2026

**Description:**
Enable intelligent, AI-driven product intake and cataloging.
This milestone focuses on automating inventory creation, integrating ConsignCloud, and delivering a high-efficiency intake UI for operators.

**Outcome:**
- AI-assisted intake pipeline is functional
- Inventory synchronization is active
- Product creation time is significantly reduced

---

#### Milestone 0.8 – The Business
**Due date:** February 11, 2026

**Description:**
Activate monetization workflows through Shopify and intelligent pricing.
This milestone connects Closter's operational hub to the storefront and enables automated sale-to-fulfillment flows.

**Outcome:**
- Products can be published and sold via Shopify
- Pricing recommendations are available
- Sales and logistics workflows are automated end-to-end

---

#### Milestone 1.0 – The Scale
**Due date:** February 27, 2026

**Description:**
Deliver a scalable consignor experience with payouts and strong data isolation.
This milestone focuses on trust, transparency, and financial settlement mechanisms required for long-term growth.

**Outcome:**
- Consignor portal is live
- Payout flows are operational
- Data isolation meets financial-grade security standards

---

## Step 3 — Issues (Real Execution)

- Issues don't have fixed dates
- They are prioritized
- They are reordered
- Some are split
- Others are discarded

👉 **"This is how we work internally."**

Issues represent the actual work items. They live within milestones but maintain flexibility to adapt to changing priorities, technical discoveries, and operational needs.

---

## Step 4 — Weekly Planning (The Key)

**This is what's not being visualized elsewhere.**

Each week, the team decides:
- Which issues enter the sprint
- Which ones exit
- Which ones are blocked

**We don't plan the entire month at once because the cost of error is extremely high.**

This is normal practice, not improvisation. Weekly planning allows the team to:
- Respond to technical discoveries
- Adjust priorities based on real progress
- Handle blockers immediately
- Maintain velocity without over-commitment

---

## Why This System Works

1. **Strategic clarity** for external stakeholders (roadmap)
2. **Structural alignment** between strategy and execution (milestones)
3. **Tactical flexibility** for day-to-day work (issues)
4. **Adaptive planning** that reduces error cost (weekly planning)

This methodology ensures that Closter maintains strategic direction while preserving the agility needed for technical execution.
